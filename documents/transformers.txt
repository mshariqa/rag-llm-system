Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. They have revolutionized natural language processing and are the foundation for models like BERT, GPT, and T5. The key innovation in transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing each word.
